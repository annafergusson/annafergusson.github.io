## Bio

Anna Fergusson is passionate about teaching, data technologies, and developing ways to introduce people to learning statistics and data science that are inclusive, engaging, accessible, effective and fun. She has led several statistics and data science curriculum design projects, and supports and advances her teaching, research and data analysis activities by creating new software tools and educational technologies. Anna’s research specialty is data science and statistics education, with a focus on technology-based and technology-informed pedagogy, including but not limited to: large-scale teaching and assessment practices and tools; introduction of computer programming for data science and associated design principles for tool and task design; tool-mediated development of statistical concepts and reasoning, such as graphical and visual inference; frameworks for observable integrated statistical and computational thinking practices; and designing professional development opportunities for high school data science teachers.
